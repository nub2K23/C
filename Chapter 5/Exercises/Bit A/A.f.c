/* 
The output of the given code will be an infinite loop printing the value of x in each iteration. However, due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in 
computers, the loop may not terminate as expected.

In most programming languages, floating-point numbers are represented using binary fractions, and not all decimal fractions can be precisely represented. 
In this case, the value of x starts at 1.1 and is decremented by 0.1 in each iteration. However, due to the limited precision of floating-point 
representation, x may never be exactly equal to 1.1, and the loop may not exit.

It's generally not recommended to compare floating-point numbers for equality directly in a loop condition due to precision issues. Instead, it's often better 
to use a range or a tolerance level for comparisons.
